To get the robot to connect to the terminals on the lab computers

gedit ~/Downloads/rpi.ovpn
sudo openvpn ~/Downloads/rpi.ovpn



CONNECT THE FUCKING TERMINAL TO THE ROBOT YOU MUG. USE T MULE AND THEN JUPITER AND THE CONSOLE TO RUN CODE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING WITH YOUR LIFE

This might take a little while (a few minutes). Then launch the new training arena (simulation) using:

roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator object-search-training.launch

rostopic list
rostopic echo
rostopic info

run rviz: roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch

The command you have to use to make the robot move this is to pass values into the subscriber from thew Week 4 python script.

rostopic pub /wheels_please std_msgs/Flat32 "data:1.0" -r 10
